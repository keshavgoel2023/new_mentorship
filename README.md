Packed with features like markdown blogging, blog feed, mentor feed, scheduling features, availability setup, real-time chat and media share, opportunity board and multiple chaining for API integration, and a lot more.

V1: Instead of building a mentoring platform from scratch, clone and deploy to get a lot of features out of the box, and add additional features as required. (Completed)

V2: Enter certain parameters and get the platform deployed within minutes, all automated. (In progress)
